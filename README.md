# RWC (Remote Work Clock)

RWC is a simple digital clock designed for remote workers. It features a customizable appearance and a settings page to adjust background and text colors. 
### Note that more features will be added soon such as setting timers/alarms, adding sounds, and changing fonts.

## Getting Started

To get started, you need to have Python installed on your computer along with the required libraries, `tkinter` and `datetime`. You can install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you haven't already.

After installing Python, download the provided Python script (RWC.py) and save it to a desired location on your computer.

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where the program is saved.
2. Run the program by entering the following command:

    ```
    python RWC.py
    ```
    
3. Once the command is run the Clock will appear on screen.

## Usage

Once the window is running, you may click the `Settings` button to access the settings page. From there, you can click the `Appearance` button to access the appearance settings. You can choose background and text colors to your liking by clicking the buttons in the `colorchooser` chart.

Users may also set alarms by clicking the `Set Alarm` button to go to the alarm page. Users may select their timers by clicking on any of the 3 list boxes and then clicking the `Start` button. The `Reset` button will stop any running timers and will reset all values to zero

On the alarm page there is also a `Manage Messages` button that allows users to create their own custom messages by entering a prompt into the entry field above the listbox and pressing the `Add` button. You can also `Remove` and `Edit` messages by selecting any message in the listbox and clicking the respective buttons.

To go back to the settings page, click the `Back` button on any of the other pages. To go back to the main window from the settings page, click the `Close` button.

## Feedback
Any Feedback is greatly appreciated as it will help me improve my code. I'm open to any new ideas or improvements.
